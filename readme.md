### Player-Warp
## Description
This plugin allows players to create warps for free or a configured price. This price can be either virtual money and/or items. A full overview can be found at its download page:

It runs on the Spigot API and is my first Java project ever. This means that at the time I didn't know about any design patters/good programming habits. I have since refactored it a bit, but it still isn't perfect :).

## Known bugs
 - Some ItemMeta gets lost in (de)serializing

## Current feature requests
 - A way to ban people from warps
