#### Player-Warp
## To-do list:
- Add option to change gui refresh rate
- Add compatibilty for old version
- Automated remover for old warps?
- Fix lacking JavaDoc :)
- Reset item?
- Reset lore?
- Clear old warps

## Ideas:
- Particle effects (might make an addon)
- Gui managing per warp (might make an addon idk)
- Different sorting for gui -> but based on what though; possible ideas so far: visitors, alphabetically, item

## Bugs:
- Not compatible with world loading plugins (add post loading system)
